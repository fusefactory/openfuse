## PureData for mobile application (iOS - Android)

The easiest way to implement generative audio inside mobile app is using pure data (https://puredata.info/). Pure data for mobile is available for iOS (https://github.com/libpd/pd-for-ios) and for Android (https://github.com/libpd/pd-for-ios). The interesting thing is that you can use Pure Data files (.pd), same patch for windows, mac os, iOS and Android.
