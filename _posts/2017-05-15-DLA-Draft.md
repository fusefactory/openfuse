![Andy Lomas. Growth by aggregation. 2005]({{site.baseurl}}/images/aggregation_004.jpg)

Diffusion limited aggregation is a technique that attempts to simulate certain forms of growth. It is interesting in that it is both very simple and has broad applications to many diverse phenomena. It has been used to model coral, dendritic crystals, lightning, and snowflakes.

The premise is that you have particles moving randomly. This is called Brownian motion, which has an interesting history in its own right. When a particle hits a static structure, it sticks to it. In the most basic implementation, you start with a single fixed particle and add new particles in the manner described one at a time. The process naturally forms branches structures as the extremities of the growth act to block particles from hitting the interior parts of the static structure.

**Basic Implementation**


There are two approaches to a basic DLA simulation. One works on a fixed grid and the other is grid-free and uses particles. This difference is reflected in many simulation techniques. Grids provide a rigid structure that simplifies the model. In this case a particle can only move along the grid to one of its four neighbours. Working without a grid provides more freedom, but generally creates additional complexity, which can mean it is harder to program or requires more computation.

Here's a grid example.
```
int[][] grid;
//the pixels taken up by one grid square
int grid_size = 2;
void setup() {
  size(600,600);
  background(255);
  fill(0);
  //initialize grid
  grid = new int[width/grid_size][height/grid_size];
  for(int i=0;i<grid.length;++i) {
    for(int j=0;j<grid[0].length;++j) {
      grid[i][j] = 0;
} 
}
  grid[grid.length/2][grid[0].length/2] = 1;
  drawGridSquare(grid.length/2,grid[0].length/2);
}
void draw() {
  addPoint();
}
void drawGridSquare(int x, int y) {
  rect(x*grid_size,y*grid_size,grid_size,grid_size);
}
void addPoint() {
  //initialize random boundary point
  int x,y;
  if(random(1) < .5) {
    x = int(random(grid.length));
    y = int(random(2))*(grid[0].length-1);
  } else {
    x = int(random(2))*(grid.length-1);
    y = int(random(grid[0].length));
  }
  while(true) {
//check neighbors
 if(checkNeighbors(x,y) > 0) break;
//move in a random direction
 float rand = random(1.0);
 //wrap around the grid
 if(rand < .25) {
	x = (x+1)%grid.length;
 } else if(rand < .5) {
	x = (x+grid.length-1)%grid.length;
 } else if(rand < .75) {
	y = (y+1)%grid[0].length;
 } else {
	y = (y+grid[0].length-1)%grid[0].length;
 } 
 
 }
 grid[x][y] = 1;
 drawGridSquare(x,y);
 }

 int checkNeighbors(int x, int y) {
 int neighbors = 0;
 if(x > 0) neighbors += grid[x-1][y];
 if(x < grid.length-1) neighbors += grid[x+1][y];
 if(y > 0) neighbors += grid[x][y-1];
 if(y < grid[0].length-1) neighbors += grid[x][y+1];
 return neighbors;
 }


  
  ```
Note that you could run the simulation on any grid, though it would most likely require a slightly more complex data structure. You could even run it on arbitrary, irregular networks such as one formed from a voronoi diagram.

**Optimization**

Generally, complex simulations will take a lot of computation, and depending on what you want to do with them speed can be an important factor. Therefore, optimising your algorithm is often a necessary step. It is not usually necessary to talk about low level optimization, such as reducing function calls or using fast bit level operations, but higher level algorithmic optimisation are important to understand.
